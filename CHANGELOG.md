# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-11-04

### Fixed
- A game no longer crashes when an outdated plugin is installed alongside:
  shared modules left behind by an older plugin are replaced by this
  plugin's own copy instead of being used as they are.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-11-04

### Changed
- Uses less memory: the game loads when you open it, not when KOReader
  starts, so it no longer takes memory or startup time while unplayed.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-11-03

### Changed
- Picks up game-common 1.11.0: the shared on-screen keyboard (where used)
  gives every key the same letter size, and the no-repeat history helper.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-11-02

### Changed
- Picks up game-common 1.10.0: the shared Tools → Games menu also lists
  the games' new "· multiplayer" entries under Party & quiz.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-11-02

### Changed
- Listed under **Tools → Games**, grouped by category, instead of its own
  entry in the Tools menu (game-common 1.9.1).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-30

### Added
- First release: Farkle (Dix mille) to 10,000 with six pip-drawn dice, the
  Smart Box scoring set (singles, three to six of a kind, straight, three
  pairs, two triplets), farkles, hot dice and a last round for everyone once
  a player reaches the target.
- Hotseat for 2-4 players, with up to three computer players at three
  levels (Easy, Medium, Hard — Hard maximises expected points exactly).
- Game saved and restored on close, French/Spanish/German translations.
